I am a Senior Computational Scientist at Clustertech, a Hong Kong company offering advanced computation solutions.  My work is all about data: data cleansing, modelling and visualization.  People often called my job a Data scientist.  However, I consider myself a data janitor[^1] and a data philosopher.
